# Practical Approaches to Data Science with Text
**Emory University / QTM 340 / Fall 2020**

What does it mean to turn text into data? What are the data science techniques commonly employed to analyze text? How are they applied in the humanities and social sciences? How are they applied in the world? This course explores these questions by focusing on how existing methods of text analysis can be used in new and creative ways. These methods include text parsing, natural language processing, language models, and vector space models, as well as statistical approaches including cluster analysis and supervised and unsupervised learning. 

We will discuss contemporary topics including data ethics, data justice, and issues with “humans in the loop.” Introductory courses in computer science and probability and statistics are recommended as prerequisites. You will complete class exercises and homework assignments in Python. I expect you to participate in class discussion and present your final project at the end of the semester. I require some short writing assignments.
