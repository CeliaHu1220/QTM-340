    "To perform practical approaches to data science with text, we need...**text**. Some text is prepared for computational analysis and publicly available in digital libraries. We can easily get novels in the public domain as .txt files, for example, from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/). Or we can work with text from HathiTrust's vast collections through the [HathiTrust Research Center](https://analytics.hathitrust.org/). \n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to work with text from popular culture and the internet--and we do!--we need to scrape the web. To understand the necessity and significance of web scraping, let's walk through the likely data collection process behind [‚ÄúFilm Dialogue from 2,000 screenplays, Broken Down by Gender and Age‚Äù](https://pudding.cool/2017/03/film-dialogue/) or any project similar to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the biggest sources for *The Pudding*'s screenplay data was the [Cornell Movie Dialogues Corpus](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html). This is a corpus created by Cornell CIS professors Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil and Lillian Lee for their paper [\"Chameleons in imagined conversations\"](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/papers/chameleons.pdf). These researchers helpfully shared a dataset of every URL that they used to find and access the screenplays in their own project."

[Here's the rendered version](http://static.decontextualize.com/kittens.html), and [here's the HTML source code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ledeprogram/courses/master/databases/data/kittens.html).\n",

    "First we're going to use Developer Tools in Chrome to take a look at how `kittens.html` is organized. Click on the \"rendered version\" link above. In Chrome, ctrl-click (or right click) anywhere on the page and select \"Inspect Element.\" This will open Chrome's Developer Tools. Your screen should look (something) like this:\n",

As you move your mouse over the elements in the top panel, different parts of the source code will be highlighted. Chrome is showing you which parts of the source code are causing which parts of the page to show up. Pretty spiffy!\n",

What we'd like to do is write some code that is going to extract information from the HTML, like \"what is the last checkup date for each of these kittens?\" or \"what are Monsieur Whiskeur's favorite TV shows?\" To do so, we need to *parse* the HTML, and create a representation of it in our program that we can manipulate with Python.\n",

    "\n",
    "[Beautiful Soup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) is a Python library that parses HTML (even if it's poorly formatted) and allows us to extract and manipulate its contents. More specifically, it gives us some Python objects that we can call methods on to poke at the data contained therein. So instead of working with strings and bytes, we can work with Python objects, methods, and data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're using Anaconda, Beautiful Soup comes pre-installed, so there's no extra installation step! (We will learn how to install new libraries in future classes). \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that Beautiful Soup only *parses* HTML. It's left to us to actually *get* the HTML from somewhere. In most cases, we'll want to download the HTML directly from the actual web. For that, we'll use the `get` method from the Python library `requests` ([link](https://2.python-requests.org/en/master/)):\n",
    "\n",
    "**Side note:** Since you're familiar with R, you know what a function is: a block of organized, reusable code that is called by a name, and performs some sort of action. Python has functions too, as well as things called methods, which are functions that are associated only with a particular object or class. Keep on reading to see an example of the \n",
